Now you can set the 'reply_to' of the email messages sent to you by changing
the form's 'Reply To Field' in the 'Form Settings' page.

You can browse to this page using the url: http://getsimpleform.com/forms/&lt;your-api_token&gt;/edit
For the demo form this would be http://getsimpleform.com/forms/479afc5e07adc370e79cc75ad751d071/edit
